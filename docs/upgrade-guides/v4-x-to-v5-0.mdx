**2.** Then run:

```
composer update doublethreedigital/runway --with-dependencies

php artisan view:clear
```

**4.** Update complete!

**Please test locally before deploying to production!**

## Changes

### High: Add `HasRunwayResource` trait to Eloquent models

You will need to add a new `HasRunwayResource` trait to all Eloquent models configured in the Runway config:

```php
// app/Models/Order.php

use StatamicRadPack\Runway\Traits\HasRunwayResource;

class Order extends Model
{
    use HasRunwayResource;
}
```
