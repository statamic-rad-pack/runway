## Overview

<Warning>Please don't upgrade multiple major versions at once (eg. from v7 to v9). You should upgrade one major version at a time.</Warning>

To get started with the upgrade process, follow the below steps:

**1.** In your `composer.json` file, change the `statamic-rad-pack/runway` version constraint to `^9.0`:

```json
"statamic-rad-pack/runway": "^9.0"
```

**2.** Then run:

```
composer update statamic-rad-pack/runway --with-dependencies
```

**3.** Next, please ensure you have cleared the route and view caches:

```
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

**4.** Carefully review this upgrade guide for changes which may affect your project.
