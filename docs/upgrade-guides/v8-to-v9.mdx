sidebarTitle: 'v8.x to v9.0'

## Overview

<Warning>Please don't upgrade multiple major versions at once (eg. from v7 to v9). You should upgrade one major version at a time.</Warning>

To get started with the upgrade process, follow the below steps:

**1.** In your `composer.json` file, change the `statamic-rad-pack/runway` version constraint to `^9.0`:

```json
"statamic-rad-pack/runway": "^9.0"
```

**2.** Then run:

```
composer update statamic-rad-pack/runway --with-dependencies
```

**3.** Next, please ensure you have cleared the route and view caches:

```
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
```

**4.** Carefully review this upgrade guide for changes which may affect your project.

## High impact changes

### PHP and Laravel support
**Affects apps using PHP < 8.2 or Laravel < 11.**

* The minimum version of PHP is now 8.2.
* The minimum version of Laravel is now 11.

We highly recommend upgrading all the way to Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4.

## Medium impact changes

### The `scope` parameter on the Runway tag has been renamed
**Affects app using the `scope` parameter on the Runway tag**

The `scope` parameter on the Runway tag has been renamed to `query_scope` to avoid conflicts with Antlers' own `scope` parameter.

```antlers
{{ runway:post scope="food" }} {{# [!code --] #}}
{{ runway:post query_scope="food" }} {{# [!code ++] #}}
```

### `runway:rebuild-uri-cache` no longer removes global query scopes

The `runway:rebuild-uri-cache` command no longer removes global query scopes when querying models. If you were relying on this behaviour, you may remove global scopes using the `runwayRoutes` query scope:

```php
#[Scope]
public function runwayRoutes($query)
{
    return $query->withoutGlobalScopes();
}
```
