## Changes

### High: Permission keys have changed

Permission keys have changed. If you have a user role with custom permissions set, you will need to make some changes:

If you're using the **files** user repository, the permission keys in the `resources/users/roles.yaml` file should have been automatically with the new permission names.

If you're using **any other** user repository, you will need to update the permission keys manually. Examples of the changes are shown below:

-   `View Products` -> `view product`
-   `Edit Products` -> `edit product`
-   `Create new Product` -> `create product`
-   `Delete Product` -> `delete product`
