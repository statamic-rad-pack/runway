title: Search
description: Runway integrates with Statamic's Search feature, allowing you to search your Eloquent models in the Control Panel and via the `{{ search:results }}` tag.
---

## Configuration

```php config/statamic/search.php
'indexes' => [
    'myindex' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'searchables' => ['collection:blog', 'runway:order'], // [!code ++]
    ],
],
```

You can scope the resources you'd like to be searchable, using the `runway:{resourceHandle}` syntax. If you'd like everything in Runway to be searchable, you can use`runway:*`.

### Title field

By default, when displaying search results, Runway will use the first listable column as the 'title field'. If you'd like to change this, add the `title_field` option to your resource's config:

```php config/runway.php
'resources' => [
	\App\Models\Order::class => [
	    'name' => 'Orders',
		'title_field' => 'name',
	],
],
```
