title: REST API
description: Integrates with Statamic's Content API to provide a RESTful JSON API for your Eloquent models.
---

Statamic comes with a read-only API that allows you to deliver content from Statamic to your frontend, external apps, SPA, or any other desired location. Content is delivered RESTfully as JSON data.

Runway includes support for Statamic's Content API, which enables you to access your Eloquent models.

If you prefer, Runway also supports [GraphQL](/graphql).

## Enabling for resources

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to enable Statamic's REST API. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.env` file:

```
STATAMIC_API_ENABLED=true
```

Alternatively, you can enable it for all environments in `config/statamic/api.php`:

```php
'enabled' => true,
```

Next, you'll need to enable the resources you want to make available. To do this, simply add a `runway` key to your `resources` array in `config/statamic/api.php`, and provide the handles of the resources for which you wish to enable the API:

```php
'resources' => [
    'collections' => true,
    // ...
    'runway' => [
        'products' => true,
    ],
],
```

## Endpoints

Each resource will have two endpoints:

* `/api/runway/{resourceHandle}` for retrieving models associated with a resource.
* `/api/runway/{resourceHandle}/{id}` for retrieving a specific model.

## Filtering

To enable filtering for your resources, you'll need to opt in by defining a list of `allowed_filters` for each resource in your `config/statamic/api.php` configuration file:

```php
'runway' => [
    'products' => [
        'allowed_filters' => ['name', 'slug'],
    ],
],
```
